# blog-bootstrap
## Scope
This repository is created in cause of my web development learning phase starting 2023. To apply what i've learned, i'm trying to write a blog that can also be used as a template for other projects. Let's see how big it is

## Target group
This template is not suitable for every group of people and is aimed at target groups in IT, engineering or other technical or scientific fields. 

## Coming features and ideas
- Search engine for searching through all blog posts
- Dark Mode / Light Mode Switcher (and automated in dependence to the daytime)
